                <h4>Braille Buddy</h4>
                <p style="width: 80%;">Braille Buddy was the 2019 Grand prize winner of the Tartan-hacks hackathon at Carnegie Mellon University. It converts English text into braille using Arduino motors. It works by converting each character into an integer code which corresponds to which dots need to be raised on the device. I.e.&nbsp; 'e' is equivalent to '15' which means the first and fifth dot get raised.&nbsp;</p>

                <h4>Credible Collector (Creddy)</h4>
                <p style="width: 80%;">The Credible Collector was an entry in the 2020 SteelHacks hackathon at the University of Pittsburgh. The goal of the project was to create a graph of papers. Each paper would be connected to another paper which either it cited or which cited it. This would allow students to visualize the credibility of a paper they wish to use for research, where heavily cited papers would be assumed to have the most credibility.</p>

                <h4>RazzyBot</h4>
                <p style="width: 80%;">RazzyBot is a currently in progress personal project. The goal is to create an automated twitch stream utilizing a Raspberry Pi. The audience would play against the pi itself at various games. Some other features would be for it to start/stop the stream automatically, moderate chat automatically, and to scrape the chat in order to choose the audience input.</p>

                    <p>Picture is of me from Halloween 2019. I went as an old fisherman, but my friends said I just looked like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorton%27s_of_Gloucester">Gorton</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 10%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am a third year computer science student at the University of Pittsburgh. I like to ask questions and I try to think outside the box at every given opportunity, and I'm not afraid of trying weird solutions. This just means my friends get annoyed when we play games together. I also enjoy the subjects of math and philosophy which I've found have heavy overlap with CS.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some of my primary hobbies include 3D printing, art, movies, and video games. But I like new experiences so there is often a new 'hobby of the week.'&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am always looking for new opportunities, so if you are interested in having me work for you or with you I urge you to contact me.&nbsp;</p>
